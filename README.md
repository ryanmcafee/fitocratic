Fitocratic
===================

An open source health and fitness HTML5 based tracking application.

## Getting started

Make sure you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed.
Also, ensure you have python version 2.7 installed. This is needed for the build system which uses node-gyp (https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/)
Optionally, you should also have docker installed if you want to run the app in a docker container. (https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)

#Next Step - Clone the repository
```sh
git clone git@github.com:ryanmcafee/fitocratic.git
cd fitocratic - Go to the directory
npm install - Install the needed server dependencies
npm start - Start the application on your local machine
```

#Running the application in Docker

Will add this documentation soon!


Your app should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).
